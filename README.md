# ShellManager
This is a user management Shell script designed for Linux systems. It simplifies the process of creating user accounts, logging in and out, and managing personal directories directly from the terminal. The script allows users to log in, create an “exit” directory in a specified path on their system upon logout, and efficiently manage their workspace.

With this script, users can easily handle authentication and directory creation, streamlining their experience in a command-line environment. The project focuses on providing a lightweight and functional solution for basic user management tasks without unnecessary complexity. It’s perfect for those who want to simplify the user login process and keep their directories organized with minimal effort.
